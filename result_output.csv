"how non - genetic and genetic factors affect the regulation of host genes implicated in COVID - 19. We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID - 19 severity, while an association with interferon - related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non - binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS - CoV - 2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID - 19 - susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID - 19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections.

"Identification of pathogens or antibody response to pathogens in human and animals modulates the treatment strategies for naive population and subsequent infections. Diseases can be controlled and even eradicated based on the epidemiology and effective prophylaxis, which often depends on development of efficient diagnostics. In addition, combating newly emerging diseases in human as well as animal healthcare is challenging and is dependent on developing safe and efficient diagnostics. Detection of antibodies directed against specific antigens has been the method of choice for documenting prior infection. Other than zoonosis, development of inexpensive vaccines and diagnostics is a unique problem in animal healthcare. The advent of recombinant DNA technology and its application in the biotechnology industry has revolutionized animal healthcare. The use of recombinant DNA technology in animal disease diagnosis has improved the rapidity, specificity and sensitivity of various diagnostic assays. This is because of the absence of host cellular proteins in the recombinant derived antigen preparations that dramatically decrease the rate of false - positive reactions.

Objectives include the investigation of : ( i ) the prevalence of public sharing of research data and code alongside published articles",-0.6317781, What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration?

"Treatment of cancer in small island communities is frequently challenged by the isolation and scattered nature of target populations, limited economic resources and overburdened healthcare systems. Strategies that have been successful in improving access to nonsurgical treatment in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and West Timor include balancing centralised location of scarce resources ( particularly health professionals ) with minimisation of patient travel, in - country training by teams of oncology professionals from high - income countries ( HICs ), sending health professionals to train in HICs, sharing and adaptation of treatment protocols, and telehealth initiatives",-2.7293448, What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration?

"consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in Coronavirus 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) in this group. Methods An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK - wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents between the ages of 18 - 24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. Results The mental health of 18 - 24 years olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms : with 84 % reporting symptoms of depression and 72 % reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. Conclusions We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID - 19 infections in young adults",-3.2937145,What has been published about ethical and social science considerations?
